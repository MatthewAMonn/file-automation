Simple project that when ran, will sort all files inside of a specific folder and move them to another specific folder.

Wanted a way to automate organizing downloaded files since my downloaded folder was a mess.

Currently on iteration 1, which works off hard coded values within file constants.py. Iteration 2 will allow for user customization.
